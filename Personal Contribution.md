#Personal Contribution - Dianne Ocampo

My group decided to proceed with my individual proposal idea involving the Presidential Election and news coverage. My contribution involved
scraping the New York Times and Guardian APIs with Cassandra. I decided on the parameters necessary to filter our search after initial issues with too many results and a very large, messy CSV.
Even after filtering we found that we still received large results so we split up the task of going through the NYT API results together and sending our compilations to Dominique and Martin to create a master file.
I was also tasked with plotting the cleaned CSVs on R with Lars and writing the scripts. The two of us produced all the plots and script for the visuals. Afterwards, I wrote up the Final Results documentation to maintain unified language in the document.
